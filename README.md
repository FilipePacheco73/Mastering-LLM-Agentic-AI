# Mastering-LLM-Agentic-AI

## Description

This repository is a complete hands-on reproduction of the Udemy course *[LLM Engineering: Master AI and Large Language Models](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models/)* by Ed Donner. It contains practical implementations of cutting-edge techniques in large language models (LLMs), covering topics such as generative AI, agentic workflows, fine-tuning, multimodal models, and RAG pipelines.

The content is designed for AI Engineers looking to deepen their understanding of LLM applications in real-world scenarios.
